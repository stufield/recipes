Blueberry Schnapps :austria:
============================

Use tiny jars because if you open one you can drink it soon and don't have to
leave a bottle opened too long. Small mason jars work well, the ones for small
jars of jam. Take care when handling, the juice stains permanently!

## Ingredients

- mason jars
- high quality unflavored schnapps (suggest: schnapps made from grapes)
- wild blueberries (from woods; if bought: ensure red inside, not white!)
- bigger blueberries have less flavor
- white granulated sugar

## Directions

1. fill the jar half full with blueberries
1. add ~3-4 tablespoon full of sugar
1. fill the jar full of schnapps
1. leave the jar near to a warm place (e.g. oven, but not too hot & not in the
   direct sunlight)
1. shake it 3-4 times a day in order to dissolve the sugar totally
1. this phase will take about 10-14 days (always near a warm place)
1. after that you can store it in a cool dark place for at least 1 yr
1. have lots of fun drinking it!
1. **Note:** vary the amount of sugar and note on the jar the amount dissolved
   so the next year you know what level of sugar you like most
