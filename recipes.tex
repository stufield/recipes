\section*{Blueberry Schnapps} \hzline \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Use tiny jars because if you open one you can drink it soon and don't have to leave a bottle opened too long. Small mason jars work well, the ones for small jars of jam. Take care when handling, the juice stains permanently!

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mason Jars
  \item High quality unflavored schnapps. Suggest: schnapps made from grapes.
  \item Wild blueberries (from woods). If bought: ensure red inside, not white! 
          Bigger blueberries have less flavour.
  \item White granulated sugar.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Directions}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Fill the jar half full with blueberries.
 \item Add $\sim$3--4 tablespoon full of sugar.
 \item Fill the jar full of schnapps.
 \item Leave the jar near to a warm place (e.g. oven, but not too hot! \& not in the direct sunlight).
 \item Shake it 3-4 times a day in order to dissolve the sugar totally.
 \item This phase will take about 10--14 days (always near a warm place)
 \item After that you can store it in a cool dark place for at least 1 yr.
 \item And than have loots of fun drinking it!
 \item Note: vary the amount of sugar and note on the jar the amount dissolved
          so the next year you know what level of sugar you like most.
\end{enumerate}
